I have tested this on the latest versions of:
* Firefox
* Chrome

I have not used any external libraries. The requirement to support IE11 and uncertainty about whether using an actual web server is allowed greatly constrained what
I could do. I have strived to keep everything IE11 compliant by sticking to ES5 vanilla JS, but did not have time to test in IE11. With more time or clarification I
might have used Babel to use newer JS features or even a popular framework like React.
